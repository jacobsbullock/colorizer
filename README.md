# Biblical Studies Text Colorizer Project
The Biblical Language Colorizer is a project inspired by my experience teaching neurodiverse students Classical Hebrew and Hellenistic Greek. Many have found color coding the vowels in these texts helpful in helping those with learning differences to read these scripts.

The purpose of this project is to create a simple interface for the colorization of vowels in text strings to be copy and pasted into other programs.

The project is slated to be written in Python with a simple browser based interface.

# Highlight Vowels Web App
